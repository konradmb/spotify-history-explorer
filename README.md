The Spotify history explorer is a Jupyter notebook designed to help you explore and analyze your personal Spotify listening history. It utilizes the data exported from Spotify's "Download your data" feature, providing you with valuable insights into your music consumption habits.

Key Features:
1. Total Play Time:\
    The program calculates and displays the total amount of time you have spent listening to music on Spotify. This metric gives you an overview of the cumulative duration of your music listening experience.

2. Money Paid to Rightholders:\
    The Spotify History Explorer also presents the amount of money paid by Spotify to rightholders based on your listening history. This information is unreliable and should be taken with grain of salt.

3. Data Range:\
    The program identifies the specific time range covered by your exported Spotify data. By indicating the starting and ending dates, you gain a clear understanding of the period for which your listening history is analyzed.

4. Most Played Songs:\
    The Spotify History Explorer highlights the most frequently played songs from your listening history. This feature allows you to discover the tracks that have resonated with you the most and reflect your musical preferences.

5. Most Played Songs by Play Time:\
    In addition to the most played songs based on the number of times they were played, the program also identifies the songs with the highest accumulated play time. This feature gives you insights into the songs that have captivated your attention for extended periods (or are simply longer than the rest).

The Spotify history explorer provides a (not) user-friendly interface to navigate through your Spotify listening history data and gain meaningful insights about your music consumption patterns. Whether you are curious about your total play time, or want to discover your favorite tracks, this program will help you explore your musical journey with ease.
